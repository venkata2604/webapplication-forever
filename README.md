# webapplication-forever


This is a basic web application which I want to use to learn and implement various web technologies. 
For example, I want to implement the backed once with Django, once with Fast API and then once with flask. 
Similarly, authentication with JWT or Oauth2 once with react once with Angular and try various bootstrap applications as well as new web architecures.
